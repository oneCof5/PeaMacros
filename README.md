# PeaMacros
An addon for World of Warcraft to set personal action bar preferences

The idea:  Create a dozen (12) character macros and link them them the action bar bindings.  Personalize them to the class/spec you're playing (using talents, etc). Add in [@mouseover,harm,nodead] style conditionals without having to also worry about [talent:5/2] style conditionals.

Now, when you change specializations, a library of a dozen new macros tailored to that spec are available for your use.

Offers:
1) The ability to save 12 macros for each talent specialization. These persist through changes and update as you edit/fine tune them.
2) The macros are standard Blizzard macros - up to 255 characters.  All we're doing is saving them and replacing them with spec-versions.
3) A library of my pathetic knowledge of various classes. (Still adding classes - I dont play anything well, and some classes I'm just bad at).

Future:
1) Add macros to action bars (configurable)
